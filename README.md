## ⚙️ **Technical Overview**

This project is a Flutter application designed to provide a comprehensive movie browsing experience. It leverages The Movie Database (TMDb) API for all movie-related data and implements a clean, modular architecture for maintainability and scalability.

### **Project Structure**

The project adheres to a layered architecture, clearly separating concerns into distinct modules:

```
movie_app/
├── lib/
│   ├── main.dart
│   └── movie_app/
│       ├── domain/             # Business logic, entities, use cases, and abstract repositories
│       │   ├── entities/       # Core data models (e.g., Movie, MovieDetails, Genre)
│       │   ├── infra/          # Interfaces for data repositories
│       │   └── usecases/       # Application-specific business rules (e.g., GetNowPlayingMoviesUseCase)

│           └── ui/             # User interface components (screens and widgets)
│               ├── widgets/    # Reusable UI elements (e.g., MoviePosterCard)

```

### **Key Dependencies**

-   `dio`: A powerful HTTP client for Dart, used for making efficient and configurable requests to the TMDb API.
-   `flutter_bloc` and `bloc`: The core libraries for implementing the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern, providing a robust and predictable way to manage application state.
-   `equatable`: Simplifies value equality comparisons for Dart objects, reducing boilerplate code and improving the reliability of BLoC state comparisons.
-   `cached_network_image`: An essential package for efficiently loading, caching, and displaying images from the network, ensuring smooth scrolling and reduced data usage.
-   `shared_preferences`: Provides a simple and persistent way to store key-value pairs locally on the device, primarily utilized for managing the user's movie watchlist.

### **API Integration**

The `MovieApiService` (located at `lib/movie_app/infra/datasources/movie_api_service.dart`) is the central component for all interactions with The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It handles:

-   **Authentication**: Uses a bearer token for secure API access.
-   **Request Handling**: Configures `Dio` with base URL and headers.
-   **Data Fetching**: Provides methods for retrieving various movie data:
    -   `fetchNowPlayingMovies`: Retrieves currently playing movies.
    -   `fetchUpcomingMovies`: Fetches movies scheduled for future release.
    -   `fetchTopRatedMovies`: Gets movies with the highest ratings.
    -   `fetchPopularMovies`: Lists the most popular movies.
    -   `fetchMovieDetails`: Retrieves comprehensive details for a specific movie by ID.
    -   `getMovieCredits`: Obtains cast and crew information for a movie.
    -   `getMovieReviews`: Fetches user reviews for a movie.
    -   `searchMovies`: Allows searching for movies by keyword.
-   **Error Handling**: Includes a robust error handling mechanism to gracefully manage network issues and API errors, providing user-friendly messages.

### **State Management (BLoC/Cubit)**

The project extensively utilizes the BLoC pattern for managing application state. Each major feature or screen has a dedicated Cubit (a simplified BLoC) responsible for handling its specific business logic and state changes. This approach ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable. Key Cubits include:

-   `NowPlayingCubit`: Manages the state for now playing movies.
-   `PopularCubit`: Handles the state for popular movies.
-   `TopRatedCubit`: Manages the state for top-rated movies.
-   `UpcomingCubit`: Controls the state for upcoming movies.
-   `FeaturedCubit`: Likely manages a featured section, possibly reusing now playing data.
-   `SearchCubit`: Manages the state and logic for movie search functionality.
-   `MovieDetailsCubit`: Handles the state for displaying detailed movie information.
-   `WatchlistCubit`: Manages the user's local movie watchlist, persisting data using `shared_preferences`.

### **UI Structure**

The user interface is organized within the `lib/movie_app/ui` directory, featuring distinct screens for different functionalities and a dedicated folder for reusable widgets:

-   `splash_screen.dart`: The initial loading screen of the application.
-   `main_screen.dart`: The primary navigation hub, likely containing bottom navigation or similar.
-   `home_screen.dart`: Displays various movie categories and lists.
-   `details_screen.dart`: Presents comprehensive information about a selected movie.
-   `search_screen.dart`: Provides an interface for users to search for movies.
-   `watchlist_screen.dart`: Displays the user's personalized list of saved movies.

Reusable UI components and widgets, such as `MoviePosterCard` (which handles lazy loading of images), are encapsulated within the `lib/movie_app/ui/widgets` subdirectory, promoting modularity and code reuse across the application.
